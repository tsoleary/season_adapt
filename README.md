# Seasonal Adaptation - Balancing Selection

## To do

### Code
- split up the do_analysis func -- make it more dynamic
- algorithms that search for evidence of snps under balancing selection (Joaquin C. B. Nunez suggestion)
- speed up code -- test each piece, maybe see if hard coding a few spots speed some things up
- think up ways to speed up crossover specifically
- try to run more with 1000 or 10000 pop sizes
- look into more intermediate crossover levels 0.25 or something like that
- try tournament selection for parent selection, with the tunable parameter k
- clean up the code a bit overall

### Writing
- write it into a story
- look into the balancing selection literature for gaps in knowledge
- the results and discussion will be written in a more cohesive way

### General
- climate change implications
- random weather events, switching between seasons, random extreme weather, more selection
- more of a gradation for the seasons
- look at the loci specific balancing graphs, are they moving less than the 0.5 xover condition
- does linkage actually hinder balancing selection?
- look at less generations per year, maybe as little at 1 or 2 per season - butterflies
- what other ways can we contribute and expand on this story?
